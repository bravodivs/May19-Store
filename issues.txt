1. on adding any oroduct or category or anythong, the page navigates to that particular php file instead of staying on index.php
    fixed by keeping only div and php in files and putting form action as empty.

2. added customer is not available in orders table in order to be allowed to order products.
    solution: check ID in cust table. if validated then use the ID to show/order orders in orders table.

3. put not null on required fields.

4. on taking cutomer ID from cutomer php, url is taking only custID var, thus removing control from orders page.
    solution: made an else case in index.php to show orders oage if custId is present in url.

5. check on all the logics/validations.
    ->product price must be greater than 0. <= done


6. add logic for generating sub_ordid in orders, else when ordering seocnd time for the same session, it is showing duplicate error key.
    solution: added the logic to generate the id whenver the enter pid form is called.
    
7. show the reciept pages {search all orders ->custID, orderID(orderId-sub_ordid), qty, total} and sum at the end.
    solution: done
    
8. order history for a particular ID. search by order ID and display all the products ascoiated with that ID.


9. add a table to the right showing products while adding the product in orders.
    solution: got the query and positioned the table at the top as relative.

10. add warning if category not selcted while registering a product.
    solution: added the else condition in product.php
